Title: Extending tidy verbs to genomic interactions
Description: A dplyr-like interface for interacting with the common Bioconductor 
    class GInteractions. By providing a grammatical
    and consistent way of manipulating these classes their accessiblity for new
    Bioconductor users is hopefully increased.
